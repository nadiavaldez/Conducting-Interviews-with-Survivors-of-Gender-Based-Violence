## Conducting Safe, Effective and Ethical Interviews with Survivors of
## Sexual and Gender-Based Violence
## 
This guide is part of WITNESS’ Video for Change how-to series on filming
safely, effectively and ethically. It’s based on the best practices
established over our 20 years of training and supporting human rights
activists in 90 countries to use video. This guide is for human rights
activists, advocates, citizen journalists, citizen filmmakers and others
who are filming and conducting interviews with survivors of gender-based
violence for human rights documentation and advocacy. Have ideas for how
this can be enhanced? Email training@witness.org

## Conducting safe, effective and ethical Interviews With survivors of
## Sexual and Gender-Based Violence
## 
_Are you planning to film an interview with someone who has experienced
sexual or gender-based violence (SGBV)? This type of interview, along
with all human rights-related interviews, requires special consideration
and preparation. A fundamental principle of using video for human rights
is doing no harm, directly or indirectly, to your interviewee in the
process of capturing their story. As a guiding principle, always ensure
that your approach, questions and conduct before, during and after the
interview respect the dignity and human rights of your interviewee. The
following tips will assist you in this process._

### Stop to Consider 
Before you proceed with interviewing a survivor of
SGBV, take time to understand and consider the impact that this
violence can have on an individual. SGBV affects everyone: women,
men and children and it is a traumatic experience for survivors. The
effects of SGBV differ for every individual and can be long-lasting
and variable over time. Common effects include (but are not limited
to): physical injuries, illness and psychological issues such as
shock, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder.

``` [IMAGE: Vidoer 2.ai] ```

In addition, there are societal attitudes and stigmas that, along with
security risks, can silence survivors and prevent them from speaking out
about their experience. When you approach survivors of SGBV and ask them
to share their stories, it is essential to treat their experience with
compassion and sensitivity. Involve your interviewee in decisions made
about the interview and respect their contributions and perspectives.
The goal is to leave the interviewee feeling empowered for having shared
their story with a present and compassionate individual. Conversely, a
rushed or interrogative interview that doesn’t take the interviewee’s
situation into account could leave the interviewee feeling re-victimized
or exploited. Always keep consideration for your interviewee at the
heart of your interview preparation and conduct.

### Before You Begin, Ask Yourself
### 
* WHY? Why do you want to use video to capture this story? Is video the
most appropriate choice?

* WHAT? What are the potential security risks you may be bringing to
your interviewee, their community and yourself by using video in your
project?

* HOW? How are you going to use this interview? First-person interviews
have often been used to make advocacy films aimed at persuading
decision-makers, as a primary source of documentation for reports; as
evidence in truth and reconciliation processes and in mobilizing
movements to reform laws, policies and behaviors.

### See How Survivor Interviews Have Been Used To Push For Change
### 
_Interviews with survivors of SGBV can be a powerful force for change,
allowing survivors to speak out and share their stories with those who
may be in a position to make a difference. Before you begin your
project, it is a good idea to watch videos that include testimonies from
SGBV survivors to familiarize yourself with various issues, styles and
approaches in using video on this topic. Check out the below videos from
past WITNESS partners and trainees to see examples of how video
interviews can be used to advocate for human rights change._

## Evaluate Safety & Security Risks
## 
### Safety and Security Questions to Ask
### 
#### What are the Specific Risks?
#### 
Video can bring new and unique safety and security risks to those
involved in creating it and there are often specific and heightened
risks for SGBV survivors. Conduct an assessment of the potential risks
for you, the interviewee, their community and others involved in the
project. Risks areas include: risks to individuals (such as violence,
arrest, detention), risks to equipment (threats to camera, equipment,
offices) and digital security risks (threats to data, files, footage,
mobile phones and communications). See
[here](http://www.witness.org/sites/default/files/downloads/videoforchange_safetyandsecurity_titled.pdf) 
for tips on creating a safety and security plan. For more on physical 
and digital security, seethe Front Line Defenders [website](http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/resources).

#### Do I Need to Protect my Interviewee’s Identity?
#### 
First, ask your interviewee if this is needed. If so, share options for
concealing identity during filming, such as filming your interviewee
with fabric obscuring their face, out of focus, against a window or from
behind. You could also avoid filming your interviewee’s face, or film
only their hands. Faces can be blurred on YouTube or with editing
software, which can also distort voices.

If you are doing a concealed-identity interview, advise your interviewee
to not mention locations, people, organizations or anything else that
could be used to identify them. Create a plan for secure footage and
materials storage, meetings and communications to prevent an outsider
from determining the identity of your interviewee.

``` [IMAGE Filming Identity.ai] ``` ``` [CAPTIONS: Silhouette; Film Hands Only; Blur in Edit] ```

#### What Else About the Interviewee Needs to Stay Confidential?
#### 
Ensure understanding by all involved parties (interviewee, camera person, interviewer, focal point, allies) on what can and cannot be shared publicly about the interviewee and project. Ensure that any information collected about the interviewee, including real names, locations, origins, occupations, family information, health information (for example, HIV status)and other personal information stay confidential. 

####Where is the Safest Location for the Interview?
####
Ask your interviewee where the interview can most safely be conducted. Make your presence as discreet as possible before, during and after filming to avoid inquiries that may expose your project or your interviewee. Make appropriate arrangements for your interviewee’s and your own safe travel to and from the interview location.

## Before Interview Day
## 
#### Research and Plan
#### 
Ensure that you need to film these interviews. See if interviews exist
already that you can request permission to use (from ally organizations
or service providers for example), which may allow you to avoid putting
this potential strain on interviewees altogether. Make a clear plan for
what you will do with this interview when complete. If SGBV is a new
issue for you, conduct research and speak with SGBV organizations to
familiarize yourself with this topic.

#### Identify Interviewee
#### 
When possible, rely on existing work and relationships with
interviewees, a trusted organization, service providers or other allies.
Learn as much about interviewee beforehand as possible.

#### Prepare Interviewee
#### 
As you meet your interviewee, share details about your project: its
goals, process, motives and involved parties so they have time to assess
and evaluate if and how they want to participate. Ensure your
interviewee understands that participation is entirely voluntary and no
payment will take place. Encourage your interviewee to ask questions.
Have a conversation about potential safety and security risks to the
interviewee.

#### Build Trust
#### 
Spend as much time as possible with your interviewee before the
interview. The more of a relationship you have with your interviewee,
the more comfortable they will be, which allows for a better interview.
Have they been interviewed about their experience before? What did they
like or not like about that process? Empower your interviewee by
inviting them to contribute ideas and make decisions about their
interview.

#### Develop Questions
Develop a list of questions and put them in order before interview day.

#### Choose a Safe Interview Location
#### 
Secure a location that is quiet, safe and provides confidentiality for
your interview. Ask your interviewee where will be best for them.

#### Identify Interviewer
#### 
Ideally, have two people conduct the interview - one to film and another
to ask the questions. If possible, offer male and female interviewers
and allow interviewee to pick which will make them more comfortable.

```End GLOBAL FOOTER```

## Before Interview Day
## 

#### Identify Support Options
#### 
Ask if there is anyone your interviewee would like to have present
during the interview for emotional support. If possible, obtain contact
information for a trained counselor or a sexual assault advocate that
the interviewee can speak with after the interview.

#### Schedule Interview
#### 
Let your interviewee choose a time and date that is best for them. Ask
if they need any specific arrangements (such as childcare). Share a
realistic time estimate in advance and stick to it. Most interviews take
a few hours to conduct and you should also allow time for conversation
after the interview. Ask if there is someone they do not want present
during the interview, so in case that person shows up you will know to
reschedule.

#### Gather, Prepare and Test Equipment in Advance
#### 
Prior to interview day, charge and prepare all of your equipment.
Depending on what you have available, this includes: charged batteries,
a camera with correct date and time settings, microphone, headphones,
extra memory cards, pen and paper for essential information and a tripod
to hold camera steady. Do a test run to ensure all of your equipment is
working.

``` [CAPTIONS: Tissues; Mirror; Snacks; Water] ```

``` Begin SIDEBAR ```

### Working With An Interpreter?
### 
Depending on the languages spoken by you and your interviewee, you may
need to find a trusted and qualified interpreter. Ask an organization
that works with survivors of SGBV or another ally for a recommendation
of a qualified individual who will be an appropriate choice for this
situation. Before interview day make sure you meet with the interpreter
to go over the interview questions, appropriate terminology and any
applicable security concerns. Keep in mind your interviewee, you may
need to find a trusted and qualified interpreter. Ask an organization
that works with survivors of SGBV or another ally for a recommendation
of a qualified individual who will be an appropriate choice for this
situation. Before interview day make sure you meet with the interpreter
to go over the interview questions, appropriate terminology and any
applicable security concerns. Keep in mind snacks water that your
interviewee might be more comfortable with an interpreter of a specific
gender.

On interview day, it is essential that your interpreter never speaks
over your interviewee. Ask interpreter to wait for 5 seconds after the
interviewee finishes speaking before translating and ask interviewee to
wait 5 seconds after interpreter finishes translating before continuing.
This will help facilitate the editing process.

``` End SIDEBAR ```

## Preparing Interview Questions
## 
_Preparing a list of well thought-out questions in advance is an
important step in conducting a successful interview. This is especially
important when interviewing survivors of SGBV – you want to be prepared
on interview day and avoid wasting your interviewee’s time or asking
them to repeat their story unnecessarily. Take the time to create
questions in advance that will create an effective interview and respect
the dignity and comfort of your interviewee. Once you have your list of
questions, put them in a logical order that will support a natural flow
for the conversation and share them with your interviewee in advance of
interview day._

### What to Keep in Mind When Developing Questions
### 
#### Create Open-Ended Questions
#### 
Avoid questions that can be answered with “yes” or “no”. A good way to
ensure a complete answer by your interviewee is to ask questions that
begin with prompts:

* Please describe your experience.

* Can you tell me about...?

* Explain what was said...

#### Question Ethically
#### 
Avoid directly or indirectly blaming the survivor for their experience
or implying that they could have prevented, avoided or resisted the
incident. Avoid offensive, rude or shaming language. Do not
intentionally ask questions aimed at provoking an emotional response
from your interviewee or revealing something they would prefer to keep
private. In your questions and approach, avoid reinforcing incorrect
perceptions about SGBV, such as that survivors are to blame for the acts
committed against them or that SGBV is inevitable.

#### Inappropriate Questions
#### 
``` [IMAGE: cross.ai] ```

* What were you wearing on the evening that you were raped?

* Why didn’t you have someone accompany you?

* How is it possible that you don’t know who raped you?

#### Appropriate Questions
#### 
``` [IMAGE: check.ai] ```

* Tell me about the events leading up to the assault?

* What did you do after this attack?

* What are your hopes for the future?

#### Be Conscious of Your Word Choice
#### 
The words you use are important. Be accurate - ‘rape’ is not ‘sex’.
Realize, however, that some interviewees may not use the word ‘rape’ as
they may not be comfortable speaking directly about sexual violence.
Work with your interviewee to determine the best approach, framing and
language for their interview. For example, do they identify themselves
as a victim, a survivor, neither or both? Whatever they decide, respect
this in the interview and in your final video.

``` In WITNESS layout "Set Up" appears in the footer ```

## Setting Up On Interview Day
## 
#### Help Your Interviewee Get Comfortable
#### 
Allow time for coffee or tea to help the interviewee be at ease and to
chat about other topics beforehand. Ensure that everyone in the room is
introduced to each other. Review the process with your interviewee and
determine once more if any question or topic is off-limits before you
begin the interview.

#### Plan for Pauses and Breaks
#### 
Ensure that the interviewee understands that they can stop the interview
at any time, whether for a pause or permanently.

#### Be Aware of Time
#### 
Confirm the time interviewee has available and avoid going over time.

#### Prepare for Good Sound
#### 
Turn off or unplug background noise (including all cell phones in room,
fans, air conditioners, televisions, refrigerators and radios). Use
headphones to check sound and make sure your microphone is on if you are
using one. If you’re using a clip-on microphone, ask permission to place
it on the interviewee before you do so, or have your interviewee do it
with your guidance.

#### Think About Lighting
#### 
Unless you are deliberately trying to conceal the interviewee’s
identity, ensure that the main light source is behind the camera.

```End GLOBAL FOOTER```


#### Frame The Shot
#### 
Use a tripod or flat surface to hold the camera steady. If you are not
obscuring the interviewee’s identity, frame your interviewee’s eyes
two-thirds of the way up and over in the frame and ensure that they are
facing and speaking into the empty space of the frame. Always leave
space in the shot below the interviewee’s mouth and chin for any needed
text (such as subtitles). It’s better to miss part of interviewee’s
forehead than their chin.

``` [IMAGES: Rules of Thirds Images 2.ai] ```

``` [CAPTIONS: Correct Medium Close-Up; Incorrect Close-Up; Correct
Close-Up] ```

#### Set Camera Angle and Eye-Line
#### 
Ensure that the camera lens is exactly at the interviewee’s eye-level.
Do not film from above, as this can make your interviewee look smaller
or weak. Make sure that your interviewee’s eyes are looking just off to
one side of the camera (on the side with talking space) and that the
interviewee is not looking directly at the camera.

#### Show Interviewee Their Image
#### 
Once you set up the camera, show your interviewee their image on your
camera or in a mirror to ensure that they are comfortable with how they
appear.

#### Obtain Informed Consent
####

```End GLOBAL FOOTER```


### Informed Consent
### 
Obtaining your interviewee’s informed consent is essential before you
proceed with the interview. Informed consent is the interviewee’s
agreement to be filmed and can only be provided after they understand
how the video will be used and who will see it. Ask your interviewee
what the worst-case scenario for them might be (such as their
perpetrator or community seeing the video and recognizing them) and
share potential strategies for mitigating these risks (such as
concealing their identity while filming, during the edit or using a
pseudonym). It is especially important to make clear that if this video
goes online, anyone may be able to see it now or in the future – and the
reach of the video may be amplified through social media. If the
incident is in relation to a criminal case, depending on the
jurisdiction, the footage could be subpoenaed – check with a legal
professional if this is the case.

You can document informed consent on paper or on-camera. Documenting
consent on-camera allows for the consent and important security
information to stay with the footage. To document informed consent on
camera, follow the below as a guide.

Begin with an off-camera conversation to establish that your interviewee
understands the purpose of the project and the implications of their
involvement, how the video will be used and shared, who may potentially
see it and that they are participating on a voluntary basis. Explain
that they can rescind their permission in the future, but with online
realities it is not always possible to remove materials from the
internet.

#### Now Turn the Camera on and Ask:
#### 
1. Please state your name and the date and location of this interview.

2. Do you understand what we are doing? Please explain in your own
words.

3. Do you know who may see the video and how it will be shared?

4. Can we show your face and use your real name and voice in this video?
Are there any other restrictions to using and sharing this interview
that we need to be aware of?

5. Are you aware you can refuse to answer any question and can stop the
filming process at any time, in order to ask questions, take a break or
to stop completely?

6. Do you consent to your interview being used in this manner?

## Interview Day: Conducting the Interview
## 
#### Document Informed Consent
#### 
Record interviewee’s consent on camera following informed consent
process.

#### Begin Interview
#### 
Using your question list as a guide, conduct the interview. Pay
attention to what your interviewee is saying and adjust your questions
or their order accordingly.

#### Stay Silent
#### 
Remain absolutely silent while your interviewee is speaking – don’t say
‘yes’ or ‘mmm-hmmm.’ Use non-verbal cues such as eye contact and nodding
your head to show you are listening. Make sure anyone else present at
the interview stays silent as well.

#### Stay Calm While Interviewing
#### 
Listen to interviewee actively and with empathy. Do not show shock or
horror at their stories. If you show discomfort, you will make your
interviewee uncomfortable.

#### Be Patient
#### 
It takes time for stories to come out. Be aware that the story may seem
to have ‘gaps’ - it is common for details to be lost in traumatic
experiences like SGBV. If you feel that an essential detail is missing,
go back to it - but do not push your interviewee.

#### Respect Interviewee's Limits
#### 
Remind your interviewee that if they are tired or uncomfortable, they
can stop. Pause after difficult moments for your interviewee. If your
interviewee begins crying and needs to stop the interview, give time and
space for them to compose themselves and offer the option of continuing
another time if needed.

#### Keep Camera Steady
#### 
Never move the camera or adjust the angles while your interviewee is
speaking. If you want to move closer, wait until they have finished
their response (before you ask next question) to move the camera.

#### Film Ethically
#### 
Unless you plan to use this for evidentiary purposes, do not film the
interviewee’s wounds, scars or injuries. This could cause your
interviewee to feel re-victimized. Do not ask for details you do not
need and only film what is needed.

#### Capture Empowering Images
#### 
Ensure as much as possible that you film strong and empowered images of
your interviewee and images that show who they are as an individual,
such as them doing something they enjoy.

### Conducting Unplanned Interviews
### 
_When you are conducting an interview with a survivor of SGBV, ideally
you plan, research and prepare yourself and your interviewee well before
interview day. However, if an interview opportunity that you haven’t
planned for arises - for example if you meet someone who wants to share
their story but you will not have a chance to see them again - you won’t
be able to take all of the steps outlined in this guide. In these
situations, here are the essential elements to keep in mind to conduct
spontaneous interviews more safely, effectively and ethically._

#### Safety, Security and Informed Consent
#### 
Ensure your interviewee understands who you are, how this video will be
used and who will see it. If this is going online, make sure they know
that anyone could potentially see their interview. In particular, the
interviewee should know that if the footage is shared publicly it could
be seen by their community or by their perpetrator or others who could
retaliate. Ask interviewee what security risks they might face to help
determine if they would like to participate and whether they need their
identity concealed (see Concealing Identity Tips on page 3). Obtain
interviewee’s informed consent on camera by asking your interviewee to
share in their own words the purpose of the interview and to provide how
they would like to be identified on camera.

#### Location
#### 
Move to a quieter location and ask your interviewee where the safest
area will be. Ensure that there are not individuals around to overhear
in order to protect your interviewee’s privacy.

#### Framing and Sound
#### 
Move away from background noise as much as possible. Get close for the
best sound, and use a microphone if you have it. Film your interviewee
from their shoulders to the top of their head and keep the camera stable
using a tripod or other flat surface. Have your interviewee look
slightly off to one side of the camera and not directly into it.

#### Ask Open-Ended Questions
#### 
Avoid questions that can be answered with a simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ and
instead ask questions that begin with ‘what’, ‘how’, ‘tell me’ and other
prompts. Be respectful of their limitations and stop if needed. Stay
silent while your interviewee is speaking. Ensure your interviewee has
the last word in an interview – ask them what else they would like to
add.

#### Afterwards
#### 
Exchange contact information so you can be in touch with each other
after the interview.

``` In WITNESS layout "After" appears in the footer ```

## After The Interview
## 
#### Get Your Interviewee's Feedback
#### 
Ask your interviewee about how they feel about the interview and how the
interview process was for them– what worked and what didn’t. Get their
suggestions on how the process could be improved for the future.

#### Revisit Safety and Security Measures
#### 
Ask the interviewee if there is any part of their response that they
would rather you not use for safety or other reasons and respect their
decision if so.

#### Clarify Next Steps
#### 
Discuss what the next steps are in terms of communication, process,
expectations and their involvement. Whatever commitments are made,
ensure these are upheld.

#### Support Options for Interviewee
#### 
Share with the interviewee the possibility that difficult feelings and
memories may surface following the interview and encourage them to reach
out to trusted individuals or counselors for support. Provide contact
information for a counselor or sexual assault advocate if possible.

#### Support Options for Interviewer and Team
#### 
Witnessing personal stories of trauma can be challenging, and can result
in something called secondary trauma. Learn about secondary trauma and
be on the lookout for signs. For more information, explore this New
Tactics dialogue on [Being Well and Staying
Safe](https://www.newtactics.org/conversation/being-well-and-staying-safe-resources-human-rights-defenders) 
and its accompanying resources.

#### Share The Final Video
#### 
When possible, share the final edited interview with interviewee so they
can review it for accuracy and any security concerns.

#### Stay In Touch
#### 
Keep in contact with your interviewee to share updates on progress -
where the video footage is being shown, how viewers are responding and
what impact the video and their story is creating.

#### Preserve
#### 
Maintain and store your footage safely, and securely store clear records
on safety considerations and consent. See the [Activists’ Guide to
Archiving Video](http://archiveguide.witness.org) for more.
